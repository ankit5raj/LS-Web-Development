            <h2>World Introduced To Cricket</h2>
            <p>Cricket grew out of the many stick-and
                ball games played in England 500 years
                ago. The word ‘bat’ is an old English word that
                simply means stick or club. By the seventeenth
                century, cricket had evolved enough to be
                recognisable as a distinct game. Till the middle of
                the eighteenth century, bats were roughly the same
                shape as hockey sticks, curving outwards at the
                bottom. There was a simple reason for this: the ball
                was bowled underarm, along the ground and the
                curve at the end of the bat gave the batsman the
                best chance of making contact.
                One of the peculiarities of cricket is that a
                Test match can go on for five days and still end</p>

            <h2>Origin of Cricket in India</h2>
            <p> The origins of Indian cricket are to be found in
                Bombay and the first Indian community to start
                playing the game was the small community of
                Zoroastrians, the Parsis. Brought into close contact
                with the British because of their interest in trade
                and the first Indian community to westernise, the
                Parsis founded the first Indian cricket club.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Media on Cricket</h2>
            <p>Television coverage changed cricket. It expanded
                the audience for the game by beaming cricket into
                small towns and villages. It also broadened
                cricket’s social base. Children who had never
                previously had the chance to watch international
                cricket because they lived outside the big
                cities, could now watch and learn by imitating
                their heroes.</p>

            <h2>Origin of Test Cricket</h2>
            <p> Test cricket from its origins in 1877 was
                organised as a contest between different parts of
                the British empire, not sovereign nations. The first
                Test was played between England and Australia
                when Australia was still a white-settler colony.
                Similarly, the small countries of the Caribbean
                that together make up the West Indies team
                were British colonies till well after the Second
                World War.</p>
